## Instructions to enter the problem
This can be done manually or using LLMs which are good at doing following basic instructions.

1. Your program should have a `main` function. This is the programming language specific `main` function.
    - Example: `func main()` for Go, `int main()` for C, `if __name__ == "__main__":` for Python3

1. You main function should not have any of the CP problem logic. The main function is only supposed to call the CP function, get its results and print it.

1. Make a separate function for your CP probem. It can take in anything and return anything.

1. The main function MUST print the return value. This will be used to check if the test was successful or not.
