# TarCode
Self-Hosted LeetCode.

Just a personal project made out of curiosity.

# Design Decisions
I have quickly understood that this problem is not so straightforward.
I have chosen these design decisions for V1:
- I will read the output and answer from StdOut. Last printed line will be considered as the output of the program.
- I will only be testing V1 with `int` and `string` outputs. Rest will be done in later versions.
